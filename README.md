### Welcome to queuebert

Meet the "I Wish I Didn’t Have to Exist" Slack Bot! This little helper is the unsung hero of massive organizations, ¨
bravely herding humans through endless steps and approvals like a caffeine-fueled sheepdog. It’s here to save the day
when people need a gentle (or relentless) nudge to get things moving.

Of course, the best solution would be a world where everything was perfectly coordinated without any prodding. But,
alas, in the wild world of paperwork and ping-ponging tasks, this bot is the glue (or duct tape) keeping the process
together—until the glorious day it can finally retire!
